              "Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) is a multimodal large language model created by OpenAI, and the fourth in its series of GPT foundation models.[1] It was initially released on March 14, 2023,[1] and has been made publicly available via the paid chatbot product ChatGPT Plus, and via OpenAI's API.[2]  As a transformer-based model, GPT-4 uses a paradigm where pre-training using both public data and \"data licensed from third-party providers\" is used to predict the next token. After this step, the model was then fine-tuned with reinforcement learning feedback from humans and AI for human alignment and policy compliance.[3]: 2. Observers reported that the iteration of ChatGPT using GPT-4 was an improvement on the previous iteration based on GPT-3.5, with the caveat that GPT-4 retains some of the problems with earlier revisions.[4] GPT-4 is also capable of taking images as input on ChatGPT.[5] OpenAI has declined to reveal various technical details and statistics about GPT-4, such as the precise size of the model.[6]. OpenAI introduced the first GPT model (GPT-1) in 2018, publishing a paper called \"Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training.\"[7] It was based on the transformer architecture and trained on a large corpus of books.[8] The next year, they introduced GPT-2, a larger model that could generate coherent text.[9] In 2020, they introduced GPT-3, a model with 100 times as many parameters as GPT-2, that could perform various tasks with few examples.[10] GPT-3 was further improved into GPT-3.5, which was used to create the chatbot product ChatGPT.. Rumors claim that GPT-4 has 1.76 trillion parameters, which was first estimated by the speed it was running and by George Hotz.[11]. OpenAI stated that GPT-4 is \"more reliable, creative, and able to handle much more nuanced instructions than GPT-3.5.\"[12] They produced two versions of GPT-4, with context windows of 8,192 and 32,768 tokens, a significant improvement over GPT-3.5 and GPT-3, which were limited to 4,096 and 2,049 tokens respectively.[13] Some of the capabilities of GPT-4 were predicted by OpenAI before training it, although other capabilities remained hard to predict due to breaks[14] in downstream scaling laws. Unlike its predecessors, GPT-4 is a multimodal model: it can take images as well as text as input;[15] this gives it the ability to describe the humor in unusual images, summarize text from screenshots, and answer exam questions that contain diagrams.[16]. To gain further control over GPT-4, OpenAI introduced the \"system message\", a directive in natural language given to GPT-4 in order to specify its tone of voice and task. For example, the system message can instruct the model to \"be a Shakespearean pirate\", in which case it will respond in rhyming, Shakespearean prose, or request it to \"always write the output of [its] response in JSON\", in which case the model will do so, adding keys and values as it sees fit to match the structure of its reply. In the examples provided by OpenAI, GPT-4 refused to deviate from its system message despite requests to do otherwise by the user during the conversation.[16]."

              "ChatGPT, which stands for Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer, is a large language model-based chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched on November 30, 2022, that enables users to refine and steer a conversation towards a desired length, format, style, level of detail, and language. Successive prompts and replies, known as prompt engineering, are considered at each conversation stage as a context.[2]. ChatGPT is built upon either GPT-3.5 or GPT-4—members of OpenAI's proprietary series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models, based on the transformer architecture developed by Google[3]—and is fine-tuned for conversational applications using a combination of supervised and reinforcement learning techniques.[4] ChatGPT was released as a freely available research preview, but due to its popularity, OpenAI now operates the service on a freemium model. It allows users on its free tier to access the GPT-3.5-based version. In contrast, the more advanced GPT-4-based version and priority access to newer features are provided to paid subscribers under the commercial name \"ChatGPT Plus\".. By January 2023, it had become what was then the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users and contributing to OpenAI's valuation growing to $29 billion.[5][6] ChatGPT's release spurred the development of competing products, including Bard, Ernie Bot, LLaMA, Claude, and Grok.[7] Microsoft launched its Bing Chat based on OpenAI's GPT-4. It raised concern among some observers over the potential of ChatGPT and similar programs to displace or atrophy human intelligence, enable plagiarism, or fuel misinformation.[4][8]. ChatGPT is based on particular GPT foundation models, namely GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, that were fine-tuned to target conversational usage.[9] The fine-tuning process leveraged both supervised learning as well as reinforcement learning in a process called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).[10][11] Both approaches employed human trainers to improve model performance. In the case of supervised learning, the trainers played both sides: the user and the AI assistant. In the reinforcement learning stage, human trainers first ranked responses that the model had created in a previous conversation.[12] These rankings were used to create \"reward models\" that were used to fine-tune the model further by using several iterations of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).[10][13]."

Observers reported that the iteration of ChatGPT using GPT-4 was an improvement on the previous iteration based on GPT-3.5, with the caveat that GPT-4 retains some of the problems with earlier revisions.[4] GPT-4 is also capable of taking images as input on ChatGPT.[5] OpenAI has declined to reveal various technical details and statistics about GPT-4, such as the precise size of the model.[6]. OpenAI introduced the first GPT model (GPT-1) in 2018, publishing a paper called \"Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training.\"[7] It was based on the transformer architecture and trained on a large corpus of books.[8] The next year, they introduced GPT-2, a larger model that could generate coherent text.[9] In 2020, they introduced GPT-3, a model with 100 times as many parameters as GPT-2, that could perform various tasks with few examples.[10] GPT-3 was further improved into GPT-3.5, which was used to create the chatbot product ChatGPT.. Rumors claim that GPT-4 has 1.76 trillion parameters, which was first estimated by the speed it was running and by George Hotz.[11]. OpenAI stated that GPT-4 is \"more reliable, creative, and able to handle much more nuanced instructions than GPT-3.5.\"[12] They produced two versions of GPT-4, with context windows of 8,192 and 32,768 tokens, a significant improvement over GPT-3.5 and GPT-3, which were limited to 4,096 and 2,049 tokens respectively.[13] Some of the capabilities of GPT-4 were predicted by OpenAI before training it, although other capabilities remained hard to predict due to breaks[14] in downstream scaling laws. Unlike its predecessors, GPT-4 is a multimodal model: it can take images as well as text as input;[15] this gives it the ability to describe the humor in unusual images, summarize text from screenshots, and answer exam questions that contain diagrams.[16]. To gain further control over GPT-4, OpenAI introduced the \"system message\", a directive in natural language given to GPT-4 in order to specify its tone of voice and task. For example, the system message can instruct the model to \"be a Shakespearean pirate\", in which case it will respond in rhyming, Shakespearean prose, or request it to \"always write the output of [its] response in JSON\", in which case the model will do so, adding keys and values as it sees fit to match the structure of its reply. In the examples provided by OpenAI, GPT-4 refused to deviate from its system message despite requests to do otherwise by the user during the conversation.[16].\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=GPT-4\n\nContent: ChatGPT, which stands for Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer, is a large language model-based chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched on November 30, 2022, that enables users to refine and steer a conversation towards a desired length, format, style, level of detail, and language. Successive prompts and replies, known as prompt engineering, are considered at each conversation stage as a context.[2]. ChatGPT is built upon either GPT-3.5 or GPT-4—members of OpenAI's proprietary series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models, based on the transformer architecture developed by Google[3]—and is fine-tuned for conversational applications using a combination of supervised and reinforcement learning techniques.[4] ChatGPT was released as a freely available research preview, but due to its popularity, OpenAI now operates the service on a freemium model. It allows users on its free tier to access the GPT-3.5-based version. In contrast, the more advanced GPT-4-based version and priority access to newer features are provided to paid subscribers under the commercial name \"ChatGPT Plus\".. By January 2023, it had become what was then the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users and contributing to OpenAI's valuation growing to $29 billion.[5][6] ChatGPT's release spurred the development of competing products, including Bard, Ernie Bot, LLaMA, Claude, and Grok.[7] Microsoft launched its Bing Chat based on OpenAI's GPT-4. It raised concern among some observers over the potential of ChatGPT and similar programs to displace or atrophy human intelligence, enable plagiarism, or fuel misinformation.[4][8]. ChatGPT is based on particular GPT foundation models, namely GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, that were fine-tuned to target conversational usage.[9] The fine-tuning process leveraged both supervised learning as well as reinforcement learning in a process called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).[10][11] Both approaches employed human trainers to improve model performance. In the case of supervised learning, the trainers played both sides: the user and the AI assistant. In the reinforcement learning stage, human trainers first ranked responses that the model had created in a previous conversation.[12] These rankings were used to create \"reward models\" that were used to fine-tune the model further by using several iterations of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).[10][13].\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=ChatGPT"

                "ChatGPT, which stands for Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer, is a large language model-based chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched on November 30, 2022, that enables users to refine and steer a conversation towards a desired length, format, style, level of detail, and language. Successive prompts and replies, known as prompt engineering, are considered at each conversation stage as a context.[2]. ChatGPT is built upon either GPT-3.5 or GPT-4—members of OpenAI's proprietary series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models, based on the transformer architecture developed by Google[3]—and is fine-tuned for conversational applications using a combination of supervised and reinforcement learning techniques.[4] ChatGPT was released as a freely available research preview, but due to its popularity, OpenAI now operates the service on a freemium model. It allows users on its free tier to access the GPT-3.5-based version. In contrast, the more advanced GPT-4-based version and priority access to newer features are provided to paid subscribers under the commercial name \"ChatGPT Plus\".. By January 2023, it had become what was then the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users and contributing to OpenAI's valuation growing to $29 billion.[5][6] ChatGPT's release spurred the development of competing products, including Bard, Ernie Bot, LLaMA, Claude, and Grok.[7] Microsoft launched its Bing Chat based on OpenAI's GPT-4. It raised concern among some observers over the potential of ChatGPT and similar programs to displace or atrophy human intelligence, enable plagiarism, or fuel misinformation.[4][8]. ChatGPT is based on particular GPT foundation models, namely GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, that were fine-tuned to target conversational usage.[9] The fine-tuning process leveraged both supervised learning as well as reinforcement learning in a process called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).[10][11] Both approaches employed human trainers to improve model performance. In the case of supervised learning, the trainers played both sides: the user and the AI assistant. In the reinforcement learning stage, human trainers first ranked responses that the model had created in a previous conversation.[12] These rankings were used to create \"reward models\" that were used to fine-tune the model further by using several iterations of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).[10][13]."

To gain further control over GPT-4, OpenAI introduced the \"system message\", a directive in natural language given to GPT-4 in order to specify its tone of voice and task. For example, the system message can instruct the model to \"be a Shakespearean pirate\", in which case it will respond in rhyming, Shakespearean prose, or request it to \"always write the output of [its] response in JSON\", in which case the model will do so, adding keys and values as it sees fit to match the structure of its reply. In the examples provided by OpenAI, GPT-4 refused to deviate from its system message despite requests to do otherwise by the user during the conversation.[16].\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=GPT-4\n\nContent: ChatGPT, which stands for Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer, is a large language model-based chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched on November 30, 2022, that enables users to refine and steer a conversation towards a desired length, format, style, level of detail, and language.

OpenAI stated that GPT-4 is \"more reliable, creative, and able to handle much more nuanced instructions than GPT-3.5.\"[12] They produced two versions of GPT-4, with context windows of 8,192 and 32,768 tokens, a significant improvement over GPT-3.5 and GPT-3, which were limited to 4,096 and 2,049 tokens respectively.[13] Some of the capabilities of GPT-4 were predicted by OpenAI before training it, although other capabilities remained hard to predict due to breaks[14] in downstream scaling laws. Unlike its predecessors, GPT-4 is a multimodal model: it can take images as well as text as input;[15] this gives it the ability to describe the humor in unusual images, summarize text from screenshots, and answer exam questions that contain diagrams.[16]. To gain further control over GPT-4, OpenAI introduced the \"system message\", a directive in natural language given to GPT-4 in order to specify its tone of voice and task. For example, the system message can instruct the model to \"be a Shakespearean pirate\", in which case it will respond in rhyming, Shakespearean prose, or request it to \"always write the output of [its] response in JSON\", in which case the model will do so, adding keys and values as it sees fit to match the structure of its reply. In the examples provided by OpenAI, GPT-4 refused to deviate from its system message despite requests to do otherwise by the user during the conversation.[16]."

Successive prompts and replies, known as prompt engineering, are considered at each conversation stage as a context.[2]. ChatGPT is built upon either GPT-3.5 or GPT-4—members of OpenAI's proprietary series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models, based on the transformer architecture developed by Google[3]—and is fine-tuned for conversational applications using a combination of supervised and reinforcement learning techniques.[4] ChatGPT was released as a freely available research preview, but due to its popularity, OpenAI now operates the service on a freemium model. It allows users on its free tier to access the GPT-3.5-based version. In contrast, the more advanced GPT-4-based version and priority access to newer features are provided to paid subscribers under the commercial name \"ChatGPT Plus\".. By January 2023, it had become what was then the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users and contributing to OpenAI's valuation growing to $29 billion.[5][6] ChatGPT's release spurred the development of competing products, including Bard, Ernie Bot, LLaMA, Claude, and Grok.[7] Microsoft launched its Bing Chat based on OpenAI's GPT-4. It raised concern among some observers over the potential of ChatGPT and similar programs to displace or atrophy human intelligence, enable plagiarism, or fuel misinformation.[4][8]. ChatGPT is based on particular GPT foundation models, namely GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, that were fine-tuned to target conversational usage.[9] The fine-tuning process leveraged both supervised learning as well as reinforcement learning in a process called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).[10][11] Both approaches employed human trainers to improve model performance. In the case of supervised learning, the trainers played both sides: the user and the AI assistant. In the reinforcement learning stage, human trainers first ranked responses that the model had created in a previous conversation.[12] These rankings were used to create \"reward models\" that were used to fine-tune the model further by using several iterations of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).[10][13]."

In the reinforcement learning stage, human trainers first ranked responses that the model had created in a previous conversation.[12] These rankings were used to create \"reward models\" that were used to fine-tune the model further by using several iterations of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).[10][13].\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=ChatGPT"

              "Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) is a multimodal large language model created by OpenAI, and the fourth in its series of GPT foundation models.[1] It was initially released on March 14, 2023,[1] and has been made publicly available via the paid chatbot product ChatGPT Plus, and via OpenAI's API.[2]  As a transformer-based model, GPT-4 uses a paradigm where pre-training using both public data and \"data licensed from third-party providers\" is used to predict the next token. After this step, the model was then fine-tuned with reinforcement learning feedback from humans and AI for human alignment and policy compliance.[3]: 2. Observers reported that the iteration of ChatGPT using GPT-4 was an improvement on the previous iteration based on GPT-3.5, with the caveat that GPT-4 retains some of the problems with earlier revisions.[4] GPT-4 is also capable of taking images as input on ChatGPT.[5] OpenAI has declined to reveal various technical details and statistics about GPT-4, such as the precise size of the model.[6]. OpenAI introduced the first GPT model (GPT-1) in 2018, publishing a paper called \"Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training.\"[7] It was based on the transformer architecture and trained on a large corpus of books.[8] The next year, they introduced GPT-2, a larger model that could generate coherent text.[9] In 2020, they introduced GPT-3, a model with 100 times as many parameters as GPT-2, that could perform various tasks with few examples.[10] GPT-3 was further improved into GPT-3.5, which was used to create the chatbot product ChatGPT.. Rumors claim that GPT-4 has 1.76 trillion parameters, which was first estimated by the speed it was running and by George Hotz.[11]. OpenAI stated that GPT-4 is \"more reliable, creative, and able to handle much more nuanced instructions than GPT-3.5.\"[12] They produced two versions of GPT-4, with context windows of 8,192 and 32,768 tokens, a significant improvement over GPT-3.5 and GPT-3, which were limited to 4,096 and 2,049 tokens respectively.[13] Some of the capabilities of GPT-4 were predicted by OpenAI before training it, although other capabilities remained hard to predict due to breaks[14] in downstream scaling laws. Unlike its predecessors, GPT-4 is a multimodal model: it can take images as well as text as input;[15] this gives it the ability to describe the humor in unusual images, summarize text from screenshots, and answer exam questions that contain diagrams.[16]. To gain further control over GPT-4, OpenAI introduced the \"system message\", a directive in natural language given to GPT-4 in order to specify its tone of voice and task. For example, the system message can instruct the model to \"be a Shakespearean pirate\", in which case it will respond in rhyming, Shakespearean prose, or request it to \"always write the output of [its] response in JSON\", in which case the model will do so, adding keys and values as it sees fit to match the structure of its reply. In the examples provided by OpenAI, GPT-4 refused to deviate from its system message despite requests to do otherwise by the user during the conversation.[16]."

Successive prompts and replies, known as prompt engineering, are considered at each conversation stage as a context.[2]. ChatGPT is built upon either GPT-3.5 or GPT-4—members of OpenAI's proprietary series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models, based on the transformer architecture developed by Google[3]—and is fine-tuned for conversational applications using a combination of supervised and reinforcement learning techniques.[4] ChatGPT was released as a freely available research preview, but due to its popularity, OpenAI now operates the service on a freemium model. It allows users on its free tier to access the GPT-3.5-based version. In contrast, the more advanced GPT-4-based version and priority access to newer features are provided to paid subscribers under the commercial name \"ChatGPT Plus\".. By January 2023, it had become what was then the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users and contributing to OpenAI's valuation growing to $29 billion.[5][6] ChatGPT's release spurred the development of competing products, including Bard, Ernie Bot, LLaMA, Claude, and Grok.[7] Microsoft launched its Bing Chat based on OpenAI's GPT-4.

Always include a \"SOURCES\" section in your response.\n\nContent: Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) is a multimodal large language model created by OpenAI, and the fourth in its series of GPT foundation models.[1] It was initially released on March 14, 2023,[1] and has been made publicly available via the paid chatbot product ChatGPT Plus, and via OpenAI's API.[2]  As a transformer-based model, GPT-4 uses a paradigm where pre-training using both public data and \"data licensed from third-party providers\" is used to predict the next token. After this step, the model was then fine-tuned with reinforcement learning feedback from humans and AI for human alignment and policy compliance.[3]: 2. Observers reported that the iteration of ChatGPT using GPT-4 was an improvement on the previous iteration based on GPT-3.5, with the caveat that GPT-4 retains some of the problems with earlier revisions.[4] GPT-4 is also capable of taking images as input on ChatGPT.[5] OpenAI has declined to reveal various technical details and statistics about GPT-4, such as the precise size of the model.[6]. OpenAI introduced the first GPT model (GPT-1) in 2018, publishing a paper called \"Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training.\"[7] It was based on the transformer architecture and trained on a large corpus of books.[8] The next year, they introduced GPT-2, a larger model that could generate coherent text.[9] In 2020, they introduced GPT-3, a model with 100 times as many parameters as GPT-2, that could perform various tasks with few examples.[10] GPT-3 was further improved into GPT-3.5, which was used to create the chatbot product ChatGPT.. Rumors claim that GPT-4 has 1.76 trillion parameters, which was first estimated by the speed it was running and by George Hotz.[11]. OpenAI stated that GPT-4 is \"more reliable, creative, and able to handle much more nuanced instructions than GPT-3.5.\"[12] They produced two versions of GPT-4, with context windows of 8,192 and 32,768 tokens, a significant improvement over GPT-3.5 and GPT-3, which were limited to 4,096 and 2,049 tokens respectively.[13] Some of the capabilities of GPT-4 were predicted by OpenAI before training it, although other capabilities remained hard to predict due to breaks[14] in downstream scaling laws. Unlike its predecessors, GPT-4 is a multimodal model: it can take images as well as text as input;[15] this gives it the ability to describe the humor in unusual images, summarize text from screenshots, and answer exam questions that contain diagrams.[16]. To gain further control over GPT-4, OpenAI introduced the \"system message\", a directive in natural language given to GPT-4 in order to specify its tone of voice and task. For example, the system message can instruct the model to \"be a Shakespearean pirate\", in which case it will respond in rhyming, Shakespearean prose, or request it to \"always write the output of [its] response in JSON\", in which case the model will do so, adding keys and values as it sees fit to match the structure of its reply. In the examples provided by OpenAI, GPT-4 refused to deviate from its system message despite requests to do otherwise by the user during the conversation.[16].\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=GPT-4\n\nContent: ChatGPT, which stands for Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer, is a large language model-based chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched on November 30, 2022, that enables users to refine and steer a conversation towards a desired length, format, style, level of detail, and language. Successive prompts and replies, known as prompt engineering, are considered at each conversation stage as a context.[2]. ChatGPT is built upon either GPT-3.5 or GPT-4—members of OpenAI's proprietary series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models, based on the transformer architecture developed by Google[3]—and is fine-tuned for conversational applications using a combination of supervised and reinforcement learning techniques.[4] ChatGPT was released as a freely available research preview, but due to its popularity, OpenAI now operates the service on a freemium model. It allows users on its free tier to access the GPT-3.5-based version. In contrast, the more advanced GPT-4-based version and priority access to newer features are provided to paid subscribers under the commercial name \"ChatGPT Plus\".. By January 2023, it had become what was then the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users and contributing to OpenAI's valuation growing to $29 billion.[5][6] ChatGPT's release spurred the development of competing products, including Bard, Ernie Bot, LLaMA, Claude, and Grok.[7] Microsoft launched its Bing Chat based on OpenAI's GPT-4.

In the case of supervised learning, the trainers played both sides: the user and the AI assistant. In the reinforcement learning stage, human trainers first ranked responses that the model had created in a previous conversation.[12] These rankings were used to create \"reward models\" that were used to fine-tune the model further by using several iterations of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).[10][13].\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=ChatGPT",

After this step, the model was then fine-tuned with reinforcement learning feedback from humans and AI for human alignment and policy compliance.[3]: 2. Observers reported that the iteration of ChatGPT using GPT-4 was an improvement on the previous iteration based on GPT-3.5, with the caveat that GPT-4 retains some of the problems with earlier revisions.[4] GPT-4 is also capable of taking images as input on ChatGPT.[5] OpenAI has declined to reveal various technical details and statistics about GPT-4, such as the precise size of the model.[6]. OpenAI introduced the first GPT model (GPT-1) in 2018, publishing a paper called \"Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training.\"[7] It was based on the transformer architecture and trained on a large corpus of books.[8] The next year, they introduced GPT-2, a larger model that could generate coherent text.[9] In 2020, they introduced GPT-3, a model with 100 times as many parameters as GPT-2, that could perform various tasks with few examples.[10] GPT-3 was further improved into GPT-3.5, which was used to create the chatbot product ChatGPT.. Rumors claim that GPT-4 has 1.76 trillion parameters, which was first estimated by the speed it was running and by George Hotz.[11]. OpenAI stated that GPT-4 is \"more reliable, creative, and able to handle much more nuanced instructions than GPT-3.5.\"[12] They produced two versions of GPT-4, with context windows of 8,192 and 32,768 tokens, a significant improvement over GPT-3.5 and GPT-3, which were limited to 4,096 and 2,049 tokens respectively.[13] Some of the capabilities of GPT-4 were predicted by OpenAI before training it, although other capabilities remained hard to predict due to breaks[14] in downstream scaling laws. Unlike its predecessors, GPT-4 is a multimodal model: it can take images as well as text as input;[15] this gives it the ability to describe the humor in unusual images, summarize text from screenshots, and answer exam questions that contain diagrams.[16]. To gain further control over GPT-4, OpenAI introduced the \"system message\", a directive in natural language given to GPT-4 in order to specify its tone of voice and task. For example, the system message can instruct the model to \"be a Shakespearean pirate\", in which case it will respond in rhyming, Shakespearean prose, or request it to \"always write the output of [its] response in JSON\", in which case the model will do so, adding keys and values as it sees fit to match the structure of its reply. In the examples provided by OpenAI, GPT-4 refused to deviate from its system message despite requests to do otherwise by the user during the conversation.[16]."

Successive prompts and replies, known as prompt engineering, are considered at each conversation stage as a context.[2]. ChatGPT is built upon either GPT-3.5 or GPT-4—members of OpenAI's proprietary series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models, based on the transformer architecture developed by Google[3]—and is fine-tuned for conversational applications using a combination of supervised and reinforcement learning techniques.[4] ChatGPT was released as a freely available research preview, but due to its popularity, OpenAI now operates the service on a freemium model. It allows users on its free tier to access the GPT-3.5-based version. In contrast, the more advanced GPT-4-based version and priority access to newer features are provided to paid subscribers under the commercial name \"ChatGPT Plus\".. By January 2023, it had become what was then the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users and contributing to OpenAI's valuation growing to $29 billion.[5][6] ChatGPT's release spurred the development of competing products, including Bard, Ernie Bot, LLaMA, Claude, and Grok.[7] Microsoft launched its Bing Chat based on OpenAI's GPT-4. It raised concern among some observers over the potential of ChatGPT and similar programs to displace or atrophy human intelligence, enable plagiarism, or fuel misinformation.[4][8]. ChatGPT is based on particular GPT foundation models, namely GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, that were fine-tuned to target conversational usage.[9] The fine-tuning process leveraged both supervised learning as well as reinforcement learning in a process called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).[10][11] Both approaches employed human trainers to improve model performance. In the case of supervised learning, the trainers played both sides: the user and the AI assistant. In the reinforcement learning stage, human trainers first ranked responses that the model had created in a previous conversation.[12] These rankings were used to create \"reward models\" that were used to fine-tune the model further by using several iterations of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).[10][13]."

After this step, the model was then fine-tuned with reinforcement learning feedback from humans and AI for human alignment and policy compliance.[3]: 2. Observers reported that the iteration of ChatGPT using GPT-4 was an improvement on the previous iteration based on GPT-3.5, with the caveat that GPT-4 retains some of the problems with earlier revisions.[4] GPT-4 is also capable of taking images as input on ChatGPT.[5] OpenAI has declined to reveal various technical details and statistics about GPT-4, such as the precise size of the model.[6]. OpenAI introduced the first GPT model (GPT-1) in 2018, publishing a paper called \"Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training.\"[7] It was based on the transformer architecture and trained on a large corpus of books.[8] The next year, they introduced GPT-2, a larger model that could generate coherent text.[9] In 2020, they introduced GPT-3, a model with 100 times as many parameters as GPT-2, that could perform various tasks with few examples.[10] GPT-3 was further improved into GPT-3.5, which was used to create the chatbot product ChatGPT.. Rumors claim that GPT-4 has 1.76 trillion parameters, which was first estimated by the speed it was running and by George Hotz.[11]. OpenAI stated that GPT-4 is \"more reliable, creative, and able to handle much more nuanced instructions than GPT-3.5.\"[12] They produced two versions of GPT-4, with context windows of 8,192 and 32,768 tokens, a significant improvement over GPT-3.5 and GPT-3, which were limited to 4,096 and 2,049 tokens respectively.[13] Some of the capabilities of GPT-4 were predicted by OpenAI before training it, although other capabilities remained hard to predict due to breaks[14] in downstream scaling laws. Unlike its predecessors, GPT-4 is a multimodal model: it can take images as well as text as input;[15] this gives it the ability to describe the humor in unusual images, summarize text from screenshots, and answer exam questions that contain diagrams.[16]. To gain further control over GPT-4, OpenAI introduced the \"system message\", a directive in natural language given to GPT-4 in order to specify its tone of voice and task. For example, the system message can instruct the model to \"be a Shakespearean pirate\", in which case it will respond in rhyming, Shakespearean prose, or request it to \"always write the output of [its] response in JSON\", in which case the model will do so, adding keys and values as it sees fit to match the structure of its reply. In the examples provided by OpenAI, GPT-4 refused to deviate from its system message despite requests to do otherwise by the user during the conversation.[16].\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=GPT-4\n\nContent: ChatGPT, which stands for Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer, is a large language model-based chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched on November 30, 2022, that enables users to refine and steer a conversation towards a desired length, format, style, level of detail, and language.

OpenAI introduced the first GPT model (GPT-1) in 2018, publishing a paper called \"Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training.\"[7] It was based on the transformer architecture and trained on a large corpus of books.[8] The next year, they introduced GPT-2, a larger model that could generate coherent text.[9] In 2020, they introduced GPT-3, a model with 100 times as many parameters as GPT-2, that could perform various tasks with few examples.[10] GPT-3 was further improved into GPT-3.5, which was used to create the chatbot product ChatGPT.. Rumors claim that GPT-4 has 1.76 trillion parameters, which was first estimated by the speed it was running and by George Hotz.[11]. OpenAI stated that GPT-4 is \"more reliable, creative, and able to handle much more nuanced instructions than GPT-3.5.\"[12] They produced two versions of GPT-4, with context windows of 8,192 and 32,768 tokens, a significant improvement over GPT-3.5 and GPT-3, which were limited to 4,096 and 2,049 tokens respectively.[13] Some of the capabilities of GPT-4 were predicted by OpenAI before training it, although other capabilities remained hard to predict due to breaks[14] in downstream scaling laws. Unlike its predecessors, GPT-4 is a multimodal model: it can take images as well as text as input;[15] this gives it the ability to describe the humor in unusual images, summarize text from screenshots, and answer exam questions that contain diagrams.[16]. To gain further control over GPT-4, OpenAI introduced the \"system message\", a directive in natural language given to GPT-4 in order to specify its tone of voice and task. For example, the system message can instruct the model to \"be a Shakespearean pirate\", in which case it will respond in rhyming, Shakespearean prose, or request it to \"always write the output of [its] response in JSON\", in which case the model will do so, adding keys and values as it sees fit to match the structure of its reply. In the examples provided by OpenAI, GPT-4 refused to deviate from its system message despite requests to do otherwise by the user during the conversation.[16].\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=GPT-4\n\nContent: ChatGPT, which stands for Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer, is a large language model-based chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched on November 30, 2022, that enables users to refine and steer a conversation towards a desired length, format, style, level of detail, and language. Successive prompts and replies, known as prompt engineering, are considered at each conversation stage as a context.[2]. ChatGPT is built upon either GPT-3.5 or GPT-4—members of OpenAI's proprietary series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models, based on the transformer architecture developed by Google[3]—and is fine-tuned for conversational applications using a combination of supervised and reinforcement learning techniques.[4] ChatGPT was released as a freely available research preview, but due to its popularity, OpenAI now operates the service on a freemium model. It allows users on its free tier to access the GPT-3.5-based version. In contrast, the more advanced GPT-4-based version and priority access to newer features are provided to paid subscribers under the commercial name \"ChatGPT Plus\".. By January 2023, it had become what was then the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users and contributing to OpenAI's valuation growing to $29 billion.[5][6] ChatGPT's release spurred the development of competing products, including Bard, Ernie Bot, LLaMA, Claude, and Grok.[7] Microsoft launched its Bing Chat based on OpenAI's GPT-4. It raised concern among some observers over the potential of ChatGPT and similar programs to displace or atrophy human intelligence, enable plagiarism, or fuel misinformation.[4][8]. ChatGPT is based on particular GPT foundation models, namely GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, that were fine-tuned to target conversational usage.[9] The fine-tuning process leveraged both supervised learning as well as reinforcement learning in a process called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).[10][11] Both approaches employed human trainers to improve model performance. In the case of supervised learning, the trainers played both sides: the user and the AI assistant. In the reinforcement learning stage, human trainers first ranked responses that the model had created in a previous conversation.[12] These rankings were used to create \"reward models\" that were used to fine-tune the model further by using several iterations of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).[10][13].\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=ChatGPT"

After this step, the model was then fine-tuned with reinforcement learning feedback from humans and AI for human alignment and policy compliance.[3]: 2. Observers reported that the iteration of ChatGPT using GPT-4 was an improvement on the previous iteration based on GPT-3.5, with the caveat that GPT-4 retains some of the problems with earlier revisions.[4] GPT-4 is also capable of taking images as input on ChatGPT.[5] OpenAI has declined to reveal various technical details and statistics about GPT-4, such as the precise size of the model.[6]. OpenAI introduced the first GPT model (GPT-1) in 2018, publishing a paper called \"Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training.\"[7] It was based on the transformer architecture and trained on a large corpus of books.[8] The next year, they introduced GPT-2, a larger model that could generate coherent text.[9] In 2020, they introduced GPT-3, a model with 100 times as many parameters as GPT-2, that could perform various tasks with few examples.[10] GPT-3 was further improved into GPT-3.5, which was used to create the chatbot product ChatGPT.. Rumors claim that GPT-4 has 1.76 trillion parameters, which was first estimated by the speed it was running and by George Hotz.[11]. OpenAI stated that GPT-4 is \"more reliable, creative, and able to handle much more nuanced instructions than GPT-3.5.\"[12] They produced two versions of GPT-4, with context windows of 8,192 and 32,768 tokens, a significant improvement over GPT-3.5 and GPT-3, which were limited to 4,096 and 2,049 tokens respectively.[13] Some of the capabilities of GPT-4 were predicted by OpenAI before training it, although other capabilities remained hard to predict due to breaks[14] in downstream scaling laws. Unlike its predecessors, GPT-4 is a multimodal model: it can take images as well as text as input;[15] this gives it the ability to describe the humor in unusual images, summarize text from screenshots, and answer exam questions that contain diagrams.[16]. To gain further control over GPT-4, OpenAI introduced the \"system message\", a directive in natural language given to GPT-4 in order to specify its tone of voice and task. For example, the system message can instruct the model to \"be a Shakespearean pirate\", in which case it will respond in rhyming, Shakespearean prose, or request it to \"always write the output of [its] response in JSON\", in which case the model will do so, adding keys and values as it sees fit to match the structure of its reply. In the examples provided by OpenAI, GPT-4 refused to deviate from its system message despite requests to do otherwise by the user during the conversation.[16].\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=GPT-4\n\nContent: ChatGPT, which stands for Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer, is a large language model-based chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched on November 30, 2022, that enables users to refine and steer a conversation towards a desired length, format, style, level of detail, and language. Successive prompts and replies, known as prompt engineering, are considered at each conversation stage as a context.[2]. ChatGPT is built upon either GPT-3.5 or GPT-4—members of OpenAI's proprietary series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models, based on the transformer architecture developed by Google[3]—and is fine-tuned for conversational applications using a combination of supervised and reinforcement learning techniques.[4] ChatGPT was released as a freely available research preview, but due to its popularity, OpenAI now operates the service on a freemium model. It allows users on its free tier to access the GPT-3.5-based version. In contrast, the more advanced GPT-4-based version and priority access to newer features are provided to paid subscribers under the commercial name \"ChatGPT Plus\".. By January 2023, it had become what was then the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users and contributing to OpenAI's valuation growing to $29 billion.[5][6] ChatGPT's release spurred the development of competing products, including Bard, Ernie Bot, LLaMA, Claude, and Grok.[7] Microsoft launched its Bing Chat based on OpenAI's GPT-4. It raised concern among some observers over the potential of ChatGPT and similar programs to displace or atrophy human intelligence, enable plagiarism, or fuel misinformation.[4][8]. ChatGPT is based on particular GPT foundation models, namely GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, that were fine-tuned to target conversational usage.[9] The fine-tuning process leveraged both supervised learning as well as reinforcement learning in a process called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).[10][11] Both approaches employed human trainers to improve model performance. In the case of supervised learning, the trainers played both sides: the user and the AI assistant. In the reinforcement learning stage, human trainers first ranked responses that the model had created in a previous conversation.[12] These rankings were used to create \"reward models\" that were used to fine-tune the model further by using several iterations of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).[10][13].\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=ChatGPT",

After this step, the model was then fine-tuned with reinforcement learning feedback from humans and AI for human alignment and policy compliance.[3]: 2. Observers reported that the iteration of ChatGPT using GPT-4 was an improvement on the previous iteration based on GPT-3.5, with the caveat that GPT-4 retains some of the problems with earlier revisions.[4] GPT-4 is also capable of taking images as input on ChatGPT.[5] OpenAI has declined to reveal various technical details and statistics about GPT-4, such as the precise size of the model.[6]. OpenAI introduced the first GPT model (GPT-1) in 2018, publishing a paper called \"Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training.\"[7] It was based on the transformer architecture and trained on a large corpus of books.[8] The next year, they introduced GPT-2, a larger model that could generate coherent text.[9] In 2020, they introduced GPT-3, a model with 100 times as many parameters as GPT-2, that could perform various tasks with few examples.[10] GPT-3 was further improved into GPT-3.5, which was used to create the chatbot product ChatGPT.. Rumors claim that GPT-4 has 1.76 trillion parameters, which was first estimated by the speed it was running and by George Hotz.[11]. OpenAI stated that GPT-4 is \"more reliable, creative, and able to handle much more nuanced instructions than GPT-3.5.\"[12] They produced two versions of GPT-4, with context windows of 8,192 and 32,768 tokens, a significant improvement over GPT-3.5 and GPT-3, which were limited to 4,096 and 2,049 tokens respectively.[13] Some of the capabilities of GPT-4 were predicted by OpenAI before training it, although other capabilities remained hard to predict due to breaks[14] in downstream scaling laws. Unlike its predecessors, GPT-4 is a multimodal model: it can take images as well as text as input;[15] this gives it the ability to describe the humor in unusual images, summarize text from screenshots, and answer exam questions that contain diagrams.[16]. To gain further control over GPT-4, OpenAI introduced the \"system message\", a directive in natural language given to GPT-4 in order to specify its tone of voice and task. For example, the system message can instruct the model to \"be a Shakespearean pirate\", in which case it will respond in rhyming, Shakespearean prose, or request it to \"always write the output of [its] response in JSON\", in which case the model will do so, adding keys and values as it sees fit to match the structure of its reply. In the examples provided by OpenAI, GPT-4 refused to deviate from its system message despite requests to do otherwise by the user during the conversation.[16]."

          "ChatGPT, which stands for Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer, is a large language model-based chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched on November 30, 2022, that enables users to refine and steer a conversation towards a desired length, format, style, level of detail, and language. Successive prompts and replies, known as prompt engineering, are considered at each conversation stage as a context.[2]. ChatGPT is built upon either GPT-3.5 or GPT-4—members of OpenAI's proprietary series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models, based on the transformer architecture developed by Google[3]—and is fine-tuned for conversational applications using a combination of supervised and reinforcement learning techniques.[4] ChatGPT was released as a freely available research preview, but due to its popularity, OpenAI now operates the service on a freemium model. It allows users on its free tier to access the GPT-3.5-based version. In contrast, the more advanced GPT-4-based version and priority access to newer features are provided to paid subscribers under the commercial name \"ChatGPT Plus\".. By January 2023, it had become what was then the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users and contributing to OpenAI's valuation growing to $29 billion.[5][6] ChatGPT's release spurred the development of competing products, including Bard, Ernie Bot, LLaMA, Claude, and Grok.[7] Microsoft launched its Bing Chat based on OpenAI's GPT-4. It raised concern among some observers over the potential of ChatGPT and similar programs to displace or atrophy human intelligence, enable plagiarism, or fuel misinformation.[4][8]. ChatGPT is based on particular GPT foundation models, namely GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, that were fine-tuned to target conversational usage.[9] The fine-tuning process leveraged both supervised learning as well as reinforcement learning in a process called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).[10][11] Both approaches employed human trainers to improve model performance. In the case of supervised learning, the trainers played both sides: the user and the AI assistant. In the reinforcement learning stage, human trainers first ranked responses that the model had created in a previous conversation.[12] These rankings were used to create \"reward models\" that were used to fine-tune the model further by using several iterations of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).[10][13]."

After this step, the model was then fine-tuned with reinforcement learning feedback from humans and AI for human alignment and policy compliance.[3]: 2. Observers reported that the iteration of ChatGPT using GPT-4 was an improvement on the previous iteration based on GPT-3.5, with the caveat that GPT-4 retains some of the problems with earlier revisions.[4] GPT-4 is also capable of taking images as input on ChatGPT.[5] OpenAI has declined to reveal various technical details and statistics about GPT-4, such as the precise size of the model.[6]. OpenAI introduced the first GPT model (GPT-1) in 2018, publishing a paper called \"Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training.\"[7] It was based on the transformer architecture and trained on a large corpus of books.[8] The next year, they introduced GPT-2, a larger model that could generate coherent text.[9] In 2020, they introduced GPT-3, a model with 100 times as many parameters as GPT-2, that could perform various tasks with few examples.[10] GPT-3 was further improved into GPT-3.5, which was used to create the chatbot product ChatGPT.. Rumors claim that GPT-4 has 1.76 trillion parameters, which was first estimated by the speed it was running and by George Hotz.[11]. OpenAI stated that GPT-4 is \"more reliable, creative, and able to handle much more nuanced instructions than GPT-3.5.\"[12] They produced two versions of GPT-4, with context windows of 8,192 and 32,768 tokens, a significant improvement over GPT-3.5 and GPT-3, which were limited to 4,096 and 2,049 tokens respectively.[13] Some of the capabilities of GPT-4 were predicted by OpenAI before training it, although other capabilities remained hard to predict due to breaks[14] in downstream scaling laws. Unlike its predecessors, GPT-4 is a multimodal model: it can take images as well as text as input;[15] this gives it the ability to describe the humor in unusual images, summarize text from screenshots, and answer exam questions that contain diagrams.[16]. To gain further control over GPT-4, OpenAI introduced the \"system message\", a directive in natural language given to GPT-4 in order to specify its tone of voice and task. For example, the system message can instruct the model to \"be a Shakespearean pirate\", in which case it will respond in rhyming, Shakespearean prose, or request it to \"always write the output of [its] response in JSON\", in which case the model will do so, adding keys and values as it sees fit to match the structure of its reply. In the examples provided by OpenAI, GPT-4 refused to deviate from its system message despite requests to do otherwise by the user during the conversation.[16]."

Remember to include a \"SOURCES\" section in your response. If you are uncertain of the answer, simply reply with \"I don't know\" and avoid fabricating any information. \n\nContent: Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) is a multimodal large language model created by OpenAI, and the fourth in its series of GPT foundation models.[1] It was initially released on March 14, 2023,[1] and has been made publicly available via the paid chatbot product ChatGPT Plus, and via OpenAI's API.[2]  As a transformer-based model, GPT-4 uses a paradigm where pre-training using both public data and \"data licensed from third-party providers\" is used to predict the next token. After this step, the model was then fine-tuned with reinforcement learning feedback from humans and AI for human alignment and policy compliance.[3]: 2. Observers reported that the iteration of ChatGPT using GPT-4 was an improvement on the previous iteration based on GPT-3.5, with the caveat that GPT-4 retains some of the problems with earlier revisions.[4] GPT-4 is also capable of taking images as input on ChatGPT.[5] OpenAI has declined to reveal various technical details and statistics about GPT-4, such as the precise size of the model.[6]. OpenAI introduced the first GPT model (GPT-1) in 2018, publishing a paper called \"Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training.\"[7] It was based on the transformer architecture and trained on a large corpus of books.[8] The next year, they introduced GPT-2, a larger model that could generate coherent text.[9] In 2020, they introduced GPT-3, a model with 100 times as many parameters as GPT-2, that could perform various tasks with few examples.[10] GPT-3 was further improved into GPT-3.5, which was used to create the chatbot product ChatGPT.. Rumors claim that GPT-4 has 1.76 trillion parameters, which was first estimated by the speed it was running and by George Hotz.[11]. OpenAI stated that GPT-4 is \"more reliable, creative, and able to handle much more nuanced instructions than GPT-3.5.\"[12] They produced two versions of GPT-4, with context windows of 8,192 and 32,768 tokens, a significant improvement over GPT-3.5 and GPT-3, which were limited to 4,096 and 2,049 tokens respectively.[13] Some of the capabilities of GPT-4 were predicted by OpenAI before training it, although other capabilities remained hard to predict due to breaks[14] in downstream scaling laws. Unlike its predecessors, GPT-4 is a multimodal model: it can take images as well as text as input;[15] this gives it the ability to describe the humor in unusual images, summarize text from screenshots, and answer exam questions that contain diagrams.[16]. To gain further control over GPT-4, OpenAI introduced the \"system message\", a directive in natural language given to GPT-4 in order to specify its tone of voice and task. For example, the system message can instruct the model to \"be a Shakespearean pirate\", in which case it will respond in rhyming, Shakespearean prose, or request it to \"always write the output of [its] response in JSON\", in which case the model will do so, adding keys and values as it sees fit to match the structure of its reply. In the examples provided by OpenAI, GPT-4 refused to deviate from its system message despite requests to do otherwise by the user during the conversation.[16].\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=GPT-4\n\nContent: ChatGPT, which stands for Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer, is a large language model-based chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched on November 30, 2022, that enables users to refine and steer a conversation towards a desired length, format, style, level of detail, and language.

          "Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) is a multimodal large language model created by OpenAI, and the fourth in its series of GPT foundation models.[1] It was initially released on March 14, 2023,[1] and has been made publicly available via the paid chatbot product ChatGPT Plus, and via OpenAI's API.[2]  As a transformer-based model, GPT-4 uses a paradigm where pre-training using both public data and \"data licensed from third-party providers\" is used to predict the next token. After this step, the model was then fine-tuned with reinforcement learning feedback from humans and AI for human alignment and policy compliance.[3]: 2. Observers reported that the iteration of ChatGPT using GPT-4 was an improvement on the previous iteration based on GPT-3.5, with the caveat that GPT-4 retains some of the problems with earlier revisions.[4] GPT-4 is also capable of taking images as input on ChatGPT.[5] OpenAI has declined to reveal various technical details and statistics about GPT-4, such as the precise size of the model.[6]. OpenAI introduced the first GPT model (GPT-1) in 2018, publishing a paper called \"Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training.\"[7] It was based on the transformer architecture and trained on a large corpus of books.[8] The next year, they introduced GPT-2, a larger model that could generate coherent text.[9] In 2020, they introduced GPT-3, a model with 100 times as many parameters as GPT-2, that could perform various tasks with few examples.[10] GPT-3 was further improved into GPT-3.5, which was used to create the chatbot product ChatGPT.. Rumors claim that GPT-4 has 1.76 trillion parameters, which was first estimated by the speed it was running and by George Hotz.[11]. OpenAI stated that GPT-4 is \"more reliable, creative, and able to handle much more nuanced instructions than GPT-3.5.\"[12] They produced two versions of GPT-4, with context windows of 8,192 and 32,768 tokens, a significant improvement over GPT-3.5 and GPT-3, which were limited to 4,096 and 2,049 tokens respectively.[13] Some of the capabilities of GPT-4 were predicted by OpenAI before training it, although other capabilities remained hard to predict due to breaks[14] in downstream scaling laws. Unlike its predecessors, GPT-4 is a multimodal model: it can take images as well as text as input;[15] this gives it the ability to describe the humor in unusual images, summarize text from screenshots, and answer exam questions that contain diagrams.[16]. To gain further control over GPT-4, OpenAI introduced the \"system message\", a directive in natural language given to GPT-4 in order to specify its tone of voice and task. For example, the system message can instruct the model to \"be a Shakespearean pirate\", in which case it will respond in rhyming, Shakespearean prose, or request it to \"always write the output of [its] response in JSON\", in which case the model will do so, adding keys and values as it sees fit to match the structure of its reply. In the examples provided by OpenAI, GPT-4 refused to deviate from its system message despite requests to do otherwise by the user during the conversation.[16]."

          "ChatGPT, which stands for Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer, is a large language model-based chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched on November 30, 2022, that enables users to refine and steer a conversation towards a desired length, format, style, level of detail, and language. Successive prompts and replies, known as prompt engineering, are considered at each conversation stage as a context.[2]. ChatGPT is built upon either GPT-3.5 or GPT-4—members of OpenAI's proprietary series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models, based on the transformer architecture developed by Google[3]—and is fine-tuned for conversational applications using a combination of supervised and reinforcement learning techniques.[4] ChatGPT was released as a freely available research preview, but due to its popularity, OpenAI now operates the service on a freemium model. It allows users on its free tier to access the GPT-3.5-based version. In contrast, the more advanced GPT-4-based version and priority access to newer features are provided to paid subscribers under the commercial name \"ChatGPT Plus\".. By January 2023, it had become what was then the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users and contributing to OpenAI's valuation growing to $29 billion.[5][6] ChatGPT's release spurred the development of competing products, including Bard, Ernie Bot, LLaMA, Claude, and Grok.[7] Microsoft launched its Bing Chat based on OpenAI's GPT-4. It raised concern among some observers over the potential of ChatGPT and similar programs to displace or atrophy human intelligence, enable plagiarism, or fuel misinformation.[4][8]. ChatGPT is based on particular GPT foundation models, namely GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, that were fine-tuned to target conversational usage.[9] The fine-tuning process leveraged both supervised learning as well as reinforcement learning in a process called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).[10][11] Both approaches employed human trainers to improve model performance. In the case of supervised learning, the trainers played both sides: the user and the AI assistant. In the reinforcement learning stage, human trainers first ranked responses that the model had created in a previous conversation.[12] These rankings were used to create \"reward models\" that were used to fine-tune the model further by using several iterations of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).[10][13]."

OpenAI introduced the first GPT model (GPT-1) in 2018, publishing a paper called \"Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training.\"[7] It was based on the transformer architecture and trained on a large corpus of books.[8] The next year, they introduced GPT-2, a larger model that could generate coherent text.[9] In 2020, they introduced GPT-3, a model with 100 times as many parameters as GPT-2, that could perform various tasks with few examples.[10] GPT-3 was further improved into GPT-3.5, which was used to create the chatbot product ChatGPT.. Rumors claim that GPT-4 has 1.76 trillion parameters, which was first estimated by the speed it was running and by George Hotz.[11]. OpenAI stated that GPT-4 is \"more reliable, creative, and able to handle much more nuanced instructions than GPT-3.5.\"[12] They produced two versions of GPT-4, with context windows of 8,192 and 32,768 tokens, a significant improvement over GPT-3.5 and GPT-3, which were limited to 4,096 and 2,049 tokens respectively.[13] Some of the capabilities of GPT-4 were predicted by OpenAI before training it, although other capabilities remained hard to predict due to breaks[14] in downstream scaling laws. Unlike its predecessors, GPT-4 is a multimodal model: it can take images as well as text as input;[15] this gives it the ability to describe the humor in unusual images, summarize text from screenshots, and answer exam questions that contain diagrams.[16]. To gain further control over GPT-4, OpenAI introduced the \"system message\", a directive in natural language given to GPT-4 in order to specify its tone of voice and task. For example, the system message can instruct the model to \"be a Shakespearean pirate\", in which case it will respond in rhyming, Shakespearean prose, or request it to \"always write the output of [its] response in JSON\", in which case the model will do so, adding keys and values as it sees fit to match the structure of its reply. In the examples provided by OpenAI, GPT-4 refused to deviate from its system message despite requests to do otherwise by the user during the conversation.[16].\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=GPT-4\n\nContent: ChatGPT, which stands for Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer, is a large language model-based chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched on November 30, 2022, that enables users to refine and steer a conversation towards a desired length, format, style, level of detail, and language. Successive prompts and replies, known as prompt engineering, are considered at each conversation stage as a context.[2]. ChatGPT is built upon either GPT-3.5 or GPT-4—members of OpenAI's proprietary series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models, based on the transformer architecture developed by Google[3]—and is fine-tuned for conversational applications using a combination of supervised and reinforcement learning techniques.[4] ChatGPT was released as a freely available research preview, but due to its popularity, OpenAI now operates the service on a freemium model. It allows users on its free tier to access the GPT-3.5-based version. In contrast, the more advanced GPT-4-based version and priority access to newer features are provided to paid subscribers under the commercial name \"ChatGPT Plus\".. By January 2023, it had become what was then the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users and contributing to OpenAI's valuation growing to $29 billion.[5][6] ChatGPT's release spurred the development of competing products, including Bard, Ernie Bot, LLaMA, Claude, and Grok.[7] Microsoft launched its Bing Chat based on OpenAI's GPT-4. It raised concern among some observers over the potential of ChatGPT and similar programs to displace or atrophy human intelligence, enable plagiarism, or fuel misinformation.[4][8]. ChatGPT is based on particular GPT foundation models, namely GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, that were fine-tuned to target conversational usage.[9] The fine-tuning process leveraged both supervised learning as well as reinforcement learning in a process called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).[10][11] Both approaches employed human trainers to improve model performance. In the case of supervised learning, the trainers played both sides: the user and the AI assistant. In the reinforcement learning stage, human trainers first ranked responses that the model had created in a previous conversation.[12] These rankings were used to create \"reward models\" that were used to fine-tune the model further by using several iterations of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).[10][13].\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=ChatGPT"

          "Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) is a multimodal large language model created by OpenAI, and the fourth in its series of GPT foundation models.[1] It was initially released on March 14, 2023,[1] and has been made publicly available via the paid chatbot product ChatGPT Plus, and via OpenAI's API.[2]  As a transformer-based model, GPT-4 uses a paradigm where pre-training using both public data and \"data licensed from third-party providers\" is used to predict the next token. After this step, the model was then fine-tuned with reinforcement learning feedback from humans and AI for human alignment and policy compliance.[3]: 2. Observers reported that the iteration of ChatGPT using GPT-4 was an improvement on the previous iteration based on GPT-3.5, with the caveat that GPT-4 retains some of the problems with earlier revisions.[4] GPT-4 is also capable of taking images as input on ChatGPT.[5] OpenAI has declined to reveal various technical details and statistics about GPT-4, such as the precise size of the model.[6]. OpenAI introduced the first GPT model (GPT-1) in 2018, publishing a paper called \"Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training.\"[7] It was based on the transformer architecture and trained on a large corpus of books.[8] The next year, they introduced GPT-2, a larger model that could generate coherent text.[9] In 2020, they introduced GPT-3, a model with 100 times as many parameters as GPT-2, that could perform various tasks with few examples.[10] GPT-3 was further improved into GPT-3.5, which was used to create the chatbot product ChatGPT.. Rumors claim that GPT-4 has 1.76 trillion parameters, which was first estimated by the speed it was running and by George Hotz.[11]. OpenAI stated that GPT-4 is \"more reliable, creative, and able to handle much more nuanced instructions than GPT-3.5.\"[12] They produced two versions of GPT-4, with context windows of 8,192 and 32,768 tokens, a significant improvement over GPT-3.5 and GPT-3, which were limited to 4,096 and 2,049 tokens respectively.[13] Some of the capabilities of GPT-4 were predicted by OpenAI before training it, although other capabilities remained hard to predict due to breaks[14] in downstream scaling laws. Unlike its predecessors, GPT-4 is a multimodal model: it can take images as well as text as input;[15] this gives it the ability to describe the humor in unusual images, summarize text from screenshots, and answer exam questions that contain diagrams.[16]. To gain further control over GPT-4, OpenAI introduced the \"system message\", a directive in natural language given to GPT-4 in order to specify its tone of voice and task. For example, the system message can instruct the model to \"be a Shakespearean pirate\", in which case it will respond in rhyming, Shakespearean prose, or request it to \"always write the output of [its] response in JSON\", in which case the model will do so, adding keys and values as it sees fit to match the structure of its reply. In the examples provided by OpenAI, GPT-4 refused to deviate from its system message despite requests to do otherwise by the user during the conversation.[16]."

          "ChatGPT, which stands for Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer, is a large language model-based chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched on November 30, 2022, that enables users to refine and steer a conversation towards a desired length, format, style, level of detail, and language. Successive prompts and replies, known as prompt engineering, are considered at each conversation stage as a context.[2]. ChatGPT is built upon either GPT-3.5 or GPT-4—members of OpenAI's proprietary series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models, based on the transformer architecture developed by Google[3]—and is fine-tuned for conversational applications using a combination of supervised and reinforcement learning techniques.[4] ChatGPT was released as a freely available research preview, but due to its popularity, OpenAI now operates the service on a freemium model. It allows users on its free tier to access the GPT-3.5-based version. In contrast, the more advanced GPT-4-based version and priority access to newer features are provided to paid subscribers under the commercial name \"ChatGPT Plus\".. By January 2023, it had become what was then the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users and contributing to OpenAI's valuation growing to $29 billion.[5][6] ChatGPT's release spurred the development of competing products, including Bard, Ernie Bot, LLaMA, Claude, and Grok.[7] Microsoft launched its Bing Chat based on OpenAI's GPT-4. It raised concern among some observers over the potential of ChatGPT and similar programs to displace or atrophy human intelligence, enable plagiarism, or fuel misinformation.[4][8]. ChatGPT is based on particular GPT foundation models, namely GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, that were fine-tuned to target conversational usage.[9] The fine-tuning process leveraged both supervised learning as well as reinforcement learning in a process called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).[10][11] Both approaches employed human trainers to improve model performance. In the case of supervised learning, the trainers played both sides: the user and the AI assistant. In the reinforcement learning stage, human trainers first ranked responses that the model had created in a previous conversation.[12] These rankings were used to create \"reward models\" that were used to fine-tune the model further by using several iterations of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).[10][13]."

After this step, the model was then fine-tuned with reinforcement learning feedback from humans and AI for human alignment and policy compliance.[3]: 2. Observers reported that the iteration of ChatGPT using GPT-4 was an improvement on the previous iteration based on GPT-3.5, with the caveat that GPT-4 retains some of the problems with earlier revisions.[4] GPT-4 is also capable of taking images as input on ChatGPT.[5] OpenAI has declined to reveal various technical details and statistics about GPT-4, such as the precise size of the model.[6]. OpenAI introduced the first GPT model (GPT-1) in 2018, publishing a paper called \"Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training.\"[7] It was based on the transformer architecture and trained on a large corpus of books.[8] The next year, they introduced GPT-2, a larger model that could generate coherent text.[9] In 2020, they introduced GPT-3, a model with 100 times as many parameters as GPT-2, that could perform various tasks with few examples.[10] GPT-3 was further improved into GPT-3.5, which was used to create the chatbot product ChatGPT.. Rumors claim that GPT-4 has 1.76 trillion parameters, which was first estimated by the speed it was running and by George Hotz.[11]. OpenAI stated that GPT-4 is \"more reliable, creative, and able to handle much more nuanced instructions than GPT-3.5.\"[12] They produced two versions of GPT-4, with context windows of 8,192 and 32,768 tokens, a significant improvement over GPT-3.5 and GPT-3, which were limited to 4,096 and 2,049 tokens respectively.[13] Some of the capabilities of GPT-4 were predicted by OpenAI before training it, although other capabilities remained hard to predict due to breaks[14] in downstream scaling laws. Unlike its predecessors, GPT-4 is a multimodal model: it can take images as well as text as input;[15] this gives it the ability to describe the humor in unusual images, summarize text from screenshots, and answer exam questions that contain diagrams.[16]. To gain further control over GPT-4, OpenAI introduced the \"system message\", a directive in natural language given to GPT-4 in order to specify its tone of voice and task. For example, the system message can instruct the model to \"be a Shakespearean pirate\", in which case it will respond in rhyming, Shakespearean prose, or request it to \"always write the output of [its] response in JSON\", in which case the model will do so, adding keys and values as it sees fit to match the structure of its reply. In the examples provided by OpenAI, GPT-4 refused to deviate from its system message despite requests to do otherwise by the user during the conversation.[16].\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=GPT-4\n\nContent: ChatGPT, which stands for Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer, is a large language model-based chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched on November 30, 2022, that enables users to refine and steer a conversation towards a desired length, format, style, level of detail, and language. Successive prompts and replies, known as prompt engineering, are considered at each conversation stage as a context.[2]. ChatGPT is built upon either GPT-3.5 or GPT-4—members of OpenAI's proprietary series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models, based on the transformer architecture developed by Google[3]—and is fine-tuned for conversational applications using a combination of supervised and reinforcement learning techniques.[4] ChatGPT was released as a freely available research preview, but due to its popularity, OpenAI now operates the service on a freemium model.

In contrast, the more advanced GPT-4-based version and priority access to newer features are provided to paid subscribers under the commercial name \"ChatGPT Plus\".. By January 2023, it had become what was then the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users and contributing to OpenAI's valuation growing to $29 billion.[5][6] ChatGPT's release spurred the development of competing products, including Bard, Ernie Bot, LLaMA, Claude, and Grok.[7] Microsoft launched its Bing Chat based on OpenAI's GPT-4.

To gain further control over GPT-4, OpenAI introduced the \"system message\", a directive in natural language given to GPT-4 in order to specify its tone of voice and task. For example, the system message can instruct the model to \"be a Shakespearean pirate\", in which case it will respond in rhyming, Shakespearean prose, or request it to \"always write the output of [its] response in JSON\", in which case the model will do so, adding keys and values as it sees fit to match the structure of its reply. In the examples provided by OpenAI, GPT-4 refused to deviate from its system message despite requests to do otherwise by the user during the conversation.[16]."

              "ChatGPT, which stands for Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer, is a large language model-based chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched on November 30, 2022, that enables users to refine and steer a conversation towards a desired length, format, style, level of detail, and language. Successive prompts and replies, known as prompt engineering, are considered at each conversation stage as a context.[2]. ChatGPT is built upon either GPT-3.5 or GPT-4—members of OpenAI's proprietary series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models, based on the transformer architecture developed by Google[3]—and is fine-tuned for conversational applications using a combination of supervised and reinforcement learning techniques.[4] ChatGPT was released as a freely available research preview, but due to its popularity, OpenAI now operates the service on a freemium model. It allows users on its free tier to access the GPT-3.5-based version. In contrast, the more advanced GPT-4-based version and priority access to newer features are provided to paid subscribers under the commercial name \"ChatGPT Plus\".. By January 2023, it had become what was then the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users and contributing to OpenAI's valuation growing to $29 billion.[5][6] ChatGPT's release spurred the development of competing products, including Bard, Ernie Bot, LLaMA, Claude, and Grok.[7] Microsoft launched its Bing Chat based on OpenAI's GPT-4. It raised concern among some observers over the potential of ChatGPT and similar programs to displace or atrophy human intelligence, enable plagiarism, or fuel misinformation.[4][8]. ChatGPT is based on particular GPT foundation models, namely GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, that were fine-tuned to target conversational usage.[9] The fine-tuning process leveraged both supervised learning as well as reinforcement learning in a process called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).[10][11] Both approaches employed human trainers to improve model performance. In the case of supervised learning, the trainers played both sides: the user and the AI assistant. In the reinforcement learning stage, human trainers first ranked responses that the model had created in a previous conversation.[12] These rankings were used to create \"reward models\" that were used to fine-tune the model further by using several iterations of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).[10][13]."

For example, the system message can instruct the model to \"be a Shakespearean pirate\", in which case it will respond in rhyming, Shakespearean prose, or request it to \"always write the output of [its] response in JSON\", in which case the model will do so, adding keys and values as it sees fit to match the structure of its reply. In the examples provided by OpenAI, GPT-4 refused to deviate from its system message despite requests to do otherwise by the user during the conversation.[16].\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=GPT-4\n\nContent: ChatGPT, which stands for Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer, is a large language model-based chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched on November 30, 2022, that enables users to refine and steer a conversation towards a desired length, format, style, level of detail, and language. Successive prompts and replies, known as prompt engineering, are considered at each conversation stage as a context.[2]. ChatGPT is built upon either GPT-3.5 or GPT-4—members of OpenAI's proprietary series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models, based on the transformer architecture developed by Google[3]—and is fine-tuned for conversational applications using a combination of supervised and reinforcement learning techniques.[4] ChatGPT was released as a freely available research preview, but due to its popularity, OpenAI now operates the service on a freemium model. It allows users on its free tier to access the GPT-3.5-based version. In contrast, the more advanced GPT-4-based version and priority access to newer features are provided to paid subscribers under the commercial name \"ChatGPT Plus\".. By January 2023, it had become what was then the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users and contributing to OpenAI's valuation growing to $29 billion.[5][6] ChatGPT's release spurred the development of competing products, including Bard, Ernie Bot, LLaMA, Claude, and Grok.[7] Microsoft launched its Bing Chat based on OpenAI's GPT-4. It raised concern among some observers over the potential of ChatGPT and similar programs to displace or atrophy human intelligence, enable plagiarism, or fuel misinformation.[4][8]. ChatGPT is based on particular GPT foundation models, namely GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, that were fine-tuned to target conversational usage.[9] The fine-tuning process leveraged both supervised learning as well as reinforcement learning in a process called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).[10][11] Both approaches employed human trainers to improve model performance. In the case of supervised learning, the trainers played both sides: the user and the AI assistant. In the reinforcement learning stage, human trainers first ranked responses that the model had created in a previous conversation.[12] These rankings were used to create \"reward models\" that were used to fine-tune the model further by using several iterations of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).[10][13].\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=ChatGPT",

In the reinforcement learning stage, human trainers first ranked responses that the model had created in a previous conversation.[12] These rankings were used to create \"reward models\" that were used to fine-tune the model further by using several iterations of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).[10][13].\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=ChatGPT"
